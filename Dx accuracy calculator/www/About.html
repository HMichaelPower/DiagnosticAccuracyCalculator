    <p>If the study design is case-control (or unknown), the calculator

      you need to provide: it knows what it needs, and asks for it.<br>

    <h5><font color="#000099">Tip: use the zoom button to see detail at
        the ends of the graph </font></h5>
    The zoom button on the graph of predictive value against prevalence
    is useful for looking the PPV curve at low prevalences (close to
    zero) and the NPV curve at high prevalences (close to one).<br>
    The zoom button is normally hidden. But, if you move your mouse's
    cursor over the graph, a line of little action buttons will appear
    above the graph. Experiment with the buttons to see how they work.

    <h4><font color="#000099"> See the uncertainties in positive and
        negative predictive values</font></h4>
    The third purpose of the calculator is to visuaslize the statistical
    uncertainty in predictive values, and how increasing the sample size
    of the study increases the precision of the predictive values.
    Understanding this source of uncertainty can inform clinical
    decision making and the planning of diagnostic evaluation studies.
    However, if you are planning a diagnostic accuracy study, you should
    check out our app for <a href="Use this app to calculate the main
      measures of accuracy of a diagnostic test The clinically useful:
      Positive and negative predictive values, and show how they vary

      technically useful: True and false positive results, and true and
      false negative (TP, FP, TN, FN) test results Sensitivity and
      specificity The obvious purpose of the calculator is to calculate
      the main measures of accuracy for a diagnostic test. You can:
      Either enter the Tp, Tp, Tn, and Fn results, and calculate the
      diagnostic accuracy measures, Or enter enter the diagnostic
      accuracy measures, and calculate the the Tp, Tp, Tn, and Fn
      counts. However, the main reason for developing this app was to
      make it obvious how positive and negative predictive values vary
      with prevalence. This is crucially important to understanding: How
      the design of a diagnostic accuracy study (cohort or case-control)
      determines whether or not it can estimate the predictive values of
      a test result How the prevalence of a condition determines the
      predictive values of a test, which is particularly important when
      a test is to be used to screen for a condition when the prevalence
      is low, or to exclude a condition when the prevalence is high A
      cohort design allows the sensitivity and specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values, prevalence, and study size to be
      calculated from (TP, FP, FN, TN). In contrast, a case-control
      design allows only sensitivity and specificity to be calculated.
      Because of these constraints, the calculator requires you to first
      identify the study design. The calculator then needs to be told
      the type of data that will be entered: TP, FP, TN, FN sensitivity
      and specificity If the study design is case-control (or unknown),
      the calculator requires estimates of the prevalence and the study

      size of the study increases the precision of the predictive
      values. Understanding this source of uncertainty can inform
