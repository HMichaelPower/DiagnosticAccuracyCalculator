    <font color="#996633"><font size="+3"><b>Guide to using the
          diagnostic accuracy calculator</b></font></font><br>
    <p>You can use the calculator to compute the usual diagnostic
      accuracy measures, just as many other online calculators will do.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The calculator and guide assume that the user is familiar with
      the concepts of true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false
      negative (FN), true negative (TN), sensitivity, and specificity.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The calculator is intended to make it impossible for a user to
      obtain positive and negative predictive values for a diagnostic
      test without seeing that these vary greatly with prevalence. <br>
    </p>
    <p>The dependence of predictive values on prevalence is foregrounded
      because it is a counter-intuitive concept for almost everyone, yet
      predictive values are what clinicians need when they interpret
      test results[1, 2].<br>
    </p>
    <p>A secondary aim is to make it impossible for a user to not be
      aware that the design of a diagnostic accuracy evaluation study
      determines whether or not it can measure prevalence and positive
      and negative predictive values.<br>
    </p>
    <h3><font color="#000099">What is the difference between
        case-control and cohort study designs?</font></h3>
    <p>A&nbsp; <b>case-control study </b>tests samples from two groups
      of people: cases who are known to have the condition and cases who
      do not.<br>
      A <b>cohort study</b> tests samples from from one group, the
      cohort, who are selected to be representative of the populations
      in which the test will be used.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Case-control studies are cheaper and easier to run than cohort
      studies, because obtaining the samples for testing is quite
      straightforward compared to cohort studies. <br>
      Case-control studies tend to be done early on in evidence
      development for a new test [3].<br>
    </p>
    <p>In contrast to cohort studies, it is not possible to directly
      estimate prevalence or positive and negative predictive values
      from data provided by a case-control study. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Figures 1 to 4 illustrate these concepts in detail.<br>

    <h2><font color="#000099">Using the calculator for cohort studies<br>
      </font></h2>
    <p>Using the calculator to compute diagnostic accuracy measures is
      straightforward when TP, FP, FN, and TN are available from a
      cohort study.</p>
    <p>If the data available from a cohort study includes sensitivity
      and specificity, and you wish to compute TP, FP, FN, and TN (and
      other diagnostic accuracy measures) you will also have to enter
      the prevalence of the condition in the target population, and the
      number of samples in the study. This is a constraint of "simple
      algebra": TP, FP, FN, and TN are 4 independent variables, so their
      computation requires 4 different independent data items. With this
      knowledge, use of the calculator should be straightforward.<br>
    </p>
    <h2><font color="#000099">Using the calculator for case-control
        studies</font></h2>
    <p>If the data available from a case-control study includes
      sensitivity and specificity, the calculator can be used as
      described above for a cohort study, with one caveat about
      interpretation of the 2x2 contingency matrix: the prevalence
      specified for the condition will be included in the computation of
      TP, FP, FN, and TN. <br>
      This means that these numbers will NOT be the same as the numbers
      in the study which provided the sensitivity and specificity data.
      <br>
      In effect, the calculator reverse engineers the 2x2 table that
      would have been produced by the cohort study that would have found
      the same sensitivity and specificity. This allows it to calculate
      the positive and negative predictive values that patients and
      clinicians find easiest to understand.<br>
    </p>
    <p>If the data available from a case-control study includes TP, FP,
      FN, and TN, you will also need to enter the prevalence and study
      size to enable the calculation of predictive values. If the data
      were from a cohort study design, the study size and prevalence
      could be calculated from TP, FP, FN, and TN. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Of course, you can (mis)use the calculator by pretending that a
      case-control study was actually a cohort study, but then you would
      be given incorrect positive and negative predictive values. And,
      if you were to look at the calculated prevalence you would see
      that it is highly unlikely to reflect any potential clinical
      population.<br>
